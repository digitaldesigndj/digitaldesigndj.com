This site is hosted on a Raspberry Pi

That's the server, where it's actually sitting right now, on my dresser. If the site is a little slow, its because my consumer internet connection will only let me squeeze out about 2 Mbps up. The server is also very simple, running an ARM chipset like you would find in a smartphone, but I beleive it's more than powerful enough to saturate the network connection before the hardware starts to hold things up.
