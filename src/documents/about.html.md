It was developed in Docpad, using the Bootstrap demo and the BootSwatch Forest Theme.

My favorite feature is Markdown publishing. I just add new .html.md files to the correct folders, setup a little meta-data in the header, and start writing!

Markdown makes it fun and easy to talk about code.

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Webpage</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Example</h1>
		<p>Some Content</p>
	</body>
</html>
```

Another great feature is the ability to render not just markdown, but a whole variety of pre-processers.

ToDo:

 * Use CoffeeKup instead of Jade for markup templates.
