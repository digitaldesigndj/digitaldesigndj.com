# Docpad and NodeJS

## Why?

- Very active, smart codebase (Learn from amazing people)
- Templating Flexibility (PreProcesser Heaven)
- Framework built for programmers (By Programmers)

## Developers
- Use any templating and pre processed language you want.
- JavaScript on the Server and the Client.
- Build sites to staic HTML files, reduces infrastructure.
- Regenrate content on the fly.

## npm vs pear + wp_plugins
- Use the same package manager for everything, even developer tools.
- Enviornments come standard.

## Modularization
Different parts of the same website can be built as seperate applications.
Developers can use the templates they feel are most appropriate for each part of the site.
Services can use reuseable adapters.

## Ownership
The platform by nature is a collection of different packages, each with utilizing thier own packages, and so on... all built on top of one another. There's a more diverse, vibrant community, surrounding node than I have ever seen before. And we can carve out own own niche.
